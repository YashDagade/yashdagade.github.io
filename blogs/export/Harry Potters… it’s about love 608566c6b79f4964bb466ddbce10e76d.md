Ok so I feel compelled to blog about this because I literally don‚Äôt have much to do now. More importantly though, Harry potter‚Äôs is kinda cool.

The best narrations are those where the central themes are hard to recognize, but oh boy, are they always present, silently singing their way. I feel like Harry Potter is one of them. The central theme of unconditional love is rarely mentioned, but it's kind of silently present all along the way. I like J.K. Rowling‚Äôs subtle narration style.

I feel like the the story is really about the power of unconditional love. In a weird way, the entire story is about Lily Potter loving her child so much that she would sacrifice everything for him. And that‚Äôs what stops the rising of evil. Love defeats evil.

This parallels well with Voldemort‚Äôs unconditional love of Power, as demonstrated by Horcruxes, which are created when someone loves power so much that they kill to get it.

It‚Äôs kind of funny how Harry ends up being a child built from love and from death‚Äîhe has the unconditional love protection and Voldemort‚Äôs Horcrux. 

Also weird things - 

Harry is not the best at recognizing people, he gets better with time. But he seems overly skeptical for some and overly trusting for others. Like how did he not recognize snape as a non evil person till the end. 

Also all creatures are kind of ‚Äúseriously misunderstood creatures‚Äù

Snape is also a very good character who, in many ways, is like a second protagonist. 

Also, Draco Malfoy is a good person; he could have killed Harry but he didn‚Äôt.

Dumbledore is the ‚Äúwise old man‚Äù of the tale. Speaking of which, the movie also follows the hero‚Äôs journey quite well.

The Defense Against the Dark Arts position is kind of wack - don‚Äôt take it, no matter how good the pay is

Also is it just me or did I pick up hints of Harry and Hermoine liking each other, until the last few movies when it seemed like the writers decided to not proceed with that and instead go with Hermione and Ron?!

Pro tip: when watching it again, if you're short on time, a good PCA for the series is just watching the first movie and than "Order of the Phoenix," and the movies after that. No need to watch "Prisoner of Azkaban," "Chamber of Secrets," and "Goblet of Fire." They are good to watch but not really central to the story.
