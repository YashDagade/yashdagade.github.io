# Sadness that doesn’t go away

Tags: IDK Yet

The kind of sadness I am feeling right now is pretty sad. I feel defeated. It has hints of the feeling how how “death” would feel. And that’s not surprising since what I am experiencing is the death of my dream to attend MIT or Harvard or Stanford. It’s been almost a few weeks now, but I still have this hope that I will be able to attend Harvard in the fall. No part of me is happy for the fact that I will be attending Duke.

This sort of sadness is not going away. It’s not fading with time. Usually, I would have rewritten an narrative so far to make this all a part of the master plan. And perhaps I have started doing bits of that by looking at the merit scholarships at Duke. But it’s not accepting. I am not ready to accept my fate just yet. 

This sadness has also made me perceive reality in a way I would have never done so before. I feel separated away from my family and I don’t feel connected with them anymore. I do have some new friends and lab members that I feel connected with but these connections aren’t deep. I guess, what I am trying to say is that I am starting to realize how broken my life was. I know I have a very healthy and deep connection with my mom, but I also see how everyone in India thinks my mom has anger issues and is mentally unstable. 

This is insanity! That is how you dehumanize people. It is perhaps a good thing that I realize I don’t want to be with them anymore. I perhaps now get a choice to choose my people. People that I want to be close with, and mom is one of them. I don’t know about the rest, but I do know that majority of my family in India aren’t a part of it. 

I do know that Harvard and MIT group got majority of the best of the best people. They got the people that I would be comfortable selecting from to be my people. And that does hurt me. I am not sure if I can find close people to connect with at Duke. The smartest minds of my year are near boston, the group that includes most of the STS winners, most of the Coke Scholars, most of the senate youth guys. These are the guys who will be Mark Zuckerberg’s and Bill Gates of tomorrow.  

That sadness will not go away. 

But at least while it is present, I will now move away from the short depression phase to the long and steady building phase. I know for fact that there are multiple cracks in my system now. I have gotten more clarity. I see the problems I want to work on. So now at least due to this sadness, I can work on them. I can build myself better and stronger. 

But till that building myself isn’t finished, no matter what anyone else tells me, I know that I am not successful. No matter the congratulations and the articles, I know for fact that I have some problems that I want to work on. I know I have to build. And so as the sadness becomes a part of me, let the building begin…
