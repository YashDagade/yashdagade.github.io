Education is natural - schooling is artificial.

I love to learn. I promise every one does. We all have the inert curiysoity to question. To question anything and everything. A good education should ideally make us a better questioner not a better answerer. Answers are often more boring than questions are. Knowledge is more lame, Discovery is fun. 

Our policies on academic dishonesty make me feel kind of sad. We label people based on how good they do on tests - As, Bs, Cs, Ds, Fs. The thought process is bad - the undiscovered advantage of this is the learning of discipline and a motive to do more. A motive to chase. A motive to focus. 

I believe there is a reason why people with good grades often succeed, it is because grades are a good measure of focus. However, they are not important. The indicator measures not importance but the ability to work under pressure and to focus which is important. 

And that’s why for many of the people grades are not a problem. They are a problem for the procrastinator turned nocastinators who chose not to do stuff. They are a problem for those of us who don’t like to follow commands. They hurt these focus groups quite a bit.
