# All the advice I have for colleges

People have started to come up to me and ask me for college advice. Until now, I wouldn’t know how to answer this well. So this is my way to answer that question in a way I feel proud of. The way I am answering this question is in two parts. First, I will share my perspective about how to tackle college apps. Then, I will give some advice, the kind that I wish someone had given me when I was going through it.

Wait before you go off to read some college advice, it’s worth asking—is this advice going to be worth reading? And the answer I have to that is…IDK. Though, if you are thinking about the merit of all the advice you get, then you are probably on the right track.

I can tell you going through the process, there was a lot of bad advice I got; it wasn’t bad advice per say, it was **bad advice for me**. This may be the same for you.

Some facts about me: I am currently a full-ride AB Duke scholar and Clark Scholar for the class of 2028. I am an **international** student; I still don’t have a green card. I applied and was considered as an international applicant for all my college apps. However, in 8th grade, our family moved to the United States, and I have done all of my classes for high school here. 

I am interested in research and science. In high school, I didn’t know what I wanted to do, but I knew that research and startups resonated with things I wouldn’t mind doing growing up. I have always wanted to start a company where I can work on making cool stuff. I never knew how I was going to get there (and still don’t), but those were my aspirations.

Now, if that sounds like a person that sounds similar to you—then perhaps this blog can help shed some perspective. If not, this blog still may be helpful to you, may help give you another perspective. Or it may just be random noise—in which case, you should stop reading once you find out for certain.

So first—about college apps. The best way to do this process well is to do cool stuff—that’s it.

Do things that you want to do, and if you don’t know things you want to do yet, just do some problem-solving on some important problems—be it energy or distracted driving (those were the ones that I chose). Solve real problems and do real COOL things that would hopefully move humanity forward (even if in the tiniest of ways) or make a real human’s life easier.

And a good way to tell whether you did something cool or not is to see if the thing passes the adult test. Just see if actual adults are doing the same thing as what you were doing. The vector of doing  things that adults aim towards, be it journal publication (or conferences like NeurIPS—not the random ones) or having patents is a good way to test the significance of the work. If adults do them, that’s probably useful to humanity too.

There are many competitions that exist merely for the sake of competition and lack real-world impact. I don’t believe you should participate in these just for the award. Certainly, take part in them, but your goal should be to engage in meaningful activities. Competitions can be beneficial in that they provide deadlines, accelerating the pace at which you work. Therefore, always seek out competitions, and when you do participate, give it your all. However, never participate solely for the sake of enhancing your resume. For instance, when I conducted research, yes, I participated in ISEF, but that was primarily because I received free food (and, admittedly, a substantial amount of money) at the science fair. It wasn’t because I wanted to do science fair for the money.

For me, building tools and making stuff was the way I did it—if you didn’t already know. But if you are into speech, then perhaps you can give speeches and do some advocacy about your problem and spread the word. If you are into entrepreneurship, perhaps you can fundraise for a non-profit, or start a business for a field you are interested in.

That’s it. That’s all the fundamentals for successful college applications — it worked for me. If you are here, you probably know about my website, so you can “check me out” and let me know if the things I did sound interesting to you. Perhaps we can collaborate on some projects. 

Now, onto the advice I wish I got:

Advice on Essays:

Don’t make the essays be the novelty.

Don’t make it be the poem that gets you into Harvard if you want to be an astrophysicist. Because trust me, it’s better to be a quirkier person than to have a quirkier application. It’s better to have a very common and downright cliche essay about discovering a drug after someone who you know got a rare disease than to write the uniquest essay about the Costco shopping mall. Because one of them will move humanity forward.

Advice on Application—and marketing really:

Pretend that the person reading your application is brain-dead. They are going to skim through it and evaluate you as a person, not your writing. So make it as simple to understand as possible. If a brain-dead person can understand your application, then your application is good. The simplicity is the hard part, not the complexity. Making it such that a brain-dead person understands it is key. Your goal is to dumb down your application so much that when they think about you, they naturally think about, like Yash—the Airborne Wind Energy guy (they do use these terms for the committee, so it’s fun to do it) or, more realistically, since people reading college apps are literature majors and don’t know anything technical, so it would most likely be Yash—the energy guy.

Timeline for Application: Don’t spend too much time on it—

I did all my essay writing in the last 7 days of when apps were due and thought I wish I had started maybe a week earlier, I think I am happy I didn’t. I would much rather spend the time doing cool stuff than figuring out ways to show the cool stuff I did. It’s better to be cool than to find a cool way to show an uncool thing.

Some personal notes: Hold me accountable to this if I ever change it:

I will never ever ask for money for consulting students on college apps. Here’s why: First, the process is random; there is some research that shows that when a judge decides who should get an appeal vs. not, the difference it has between meals is crazy. Judges decide whether a person lives in a prison or not, while AOs decide who gets into a college. You can only imagine the difference is even more stark for college apps. Look up **Hungry judge effect!!!**. And second, and more importantly, there is no good reason to lock information behind a paywall—just do cool stuff—it’s actually better for humanity and that’s what matters in the long run. Your goal should not be to get into Harvard but to do cool things, and if that is your goal, then just do that and Harvard will want you. I promise.

After reading this—if you still want advice, reach out to me and I would be happy to help out :)
