# LLMs will have different metrics than apps

Increasingly, people seem to believe that LLMs will be the next era of the internet. They will offer new frontier for innovations. The Unicorns, the college dorm success stories which used to be about making an app, will now be about building services and platforms with LLMs.

I however always keep on wondering about how this future could become a reality? Selling intelligence as a service is hard, because if “intelligence” is truly intelligent than you don’t need a new intelligence for learning and another one for food plans, right?

Or do you?

Like for humans, even the richest of humans prefer to have multiple people on their team, one for cooking and one for laundry. When they could hire just one person who is really great it at all? Is the need for compartmentalization a human need? Or is just the norm till now because no such “great at it all” talent existed prior to this?

In other words when ChatGPT can do everything from searching for information to teaching you math to planning your trip, is there merit to going to a different service, when you can get the same exact thing from one interface?

Wouldn’t the friction between switching services be a burden to most people? 

Additionally, the apps and websites that truly did work in the past, they didn’t rely on a subscription model? They sold ads. But it seems like in the LLM age, the economics of the new business would be different. 

For example, Facebook decreased the friction between communication for people and it capitalized on the user data to sell adds. It had a network effect that allowed it to become a monopoly. The more people joined Facebook, the harder it was for another group like Facebook to emerge. 

For the LLM era, there needs to be another dominating factor as such that allows you to have a monopoly over a market? The intelligence that you offer has to get better with scale, either with data usage (that is that the models know so much about you that switch is a pain) or with people, such that the more people join your service the harder it becomes for a similar product to succeed. 

## What doesn’t change

One thing that I am sure would not change is that the unicorns that offer these services would have to solve a perhaps niche problem for one group of people really well. It needs to be that some people have to be big big fans of the service you create and need it daily. They can’t live without it. A good indicator for knowing when you have a good product, weather it’s an app or an LLM based service, would be the friend test. Would the product be SO GOOD that people go out of their ways  to tell their friends about it.

## Speculations

I am not sure what percentage of the population finds it acceptable to pay for software. People like to download free apps and I feel, like Instacart and amazon, are willing to pay if they save money but not willing to pay in the prospect that they will save money in the future. Specially for startups where the trust about existing a year later is still non trivial. 

I want to believe that subscription based models will succeed. But I don’t know about that. May be LLMs if they could offer cheaper subscriptions than the existing ones could succeed but in general history has shown be pretty bad for startup subscription models.
