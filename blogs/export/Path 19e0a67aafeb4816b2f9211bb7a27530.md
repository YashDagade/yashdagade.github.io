We lose with an abusive male figure who I regrettably have to refer to as family sometimes. The way this works out is this- 

1. I get into MIT, Stanford or Harvard
2. I get scholarships or take my own student debt (or go debt free)
3. We leave the idiot 
4. We go change the world 

Key for me will be scholarships or student loans and once mom gets in we can even share the loan with mom and pay it off very quickly.

I think I can get a full ride too and I can build a good support base around me to ensure that I do. Once I do become rich and kind of famous and mom becomes a billionaire, I will consider this world to be fair.
