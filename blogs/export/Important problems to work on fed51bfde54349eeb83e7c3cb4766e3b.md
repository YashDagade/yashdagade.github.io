# Important problems to work on

Tags: Start Here

Humanity is a young species. There are a lot of things that we still haven’t figured out. For one - intelligence. Also proper land use and species diversity. Also flying cars. Also nuclear battery storage. 

I hope we enter a world where all the species are preserved. Perhaps humans build a world outside Earth and use resources that the universe has to provide instead of exploiting precious earth land and resources. 

For humanity to be successful, it would be pivotal that we do expand beyond Earth. For that to happen we need a lot more intelligence and a lot more energy, and a lot more resources ( we can get the resources from the extra terrestrial planets though)

It’s safe to say that if we don’t figure out a way to extend age, than I am all but done with about 20% of my life by now. That’s a big number. And there are still tons of problems that need to be solved that aren’t. 

For one - life is still so unfair. For the riches and so much more for the poors. My benchmark for impact and success is to make sure that everyone get’s a chance to work on their creative potential and not be slowed down by the friction of society. Getting intelligence will help with that too. And so will energy. 

Intelligence will also help with diseases and helping cure them. Our DNA is just a huge massive puzzle that we need to solve, but haven’t yet. Intelligence can help with that. Solving this puzzle will also lead to curing cancer, extending age and much more. 

We also need more intelligence in the physical form. Robotics is super important. You need them to work on building things. Weather that’s rockets or underground tunnels or making food. Human labour is just wasted potential. 

None of these problems are truly that hard to solve. They do have a lot of uncertainty around them though. Humanity is still in a clay state, motivated only for short term goals. Another app that uses LLMs will probably end up becoming a billion dollar idea, but it won’t cause a dent in our trajectory. 

I guess it would be super nice to build intelligence and energy. Some vectors I want to work on for Energy include Fusion and AWEs. Some vectors I want to explore for intelligence are literally just figuring out how our brains work with 20 watts and much higher data throughput. 

I guess the way to design a future that would support such a living is to first start working on these problems. Start working on AWEs and learning machine learning algorithms and getting familiar with code. I will need a lot of money, but I am sure I can get that from creating value. I don’t need to chase it just yet. I do need to make sure however that my solutions work. There is no Plan B.

I am just going to list every problem that I feel is interesting and worth solving:

1. Intelligence
2. Energy Production and Storage
3. Genetics - Figuring out the puzzle
4. Robotics - Getting a robot to self learn and reproduce
5. Exploring Space
6. House and Home architecture. I want to design tree based systems that employ a fractal like living. 

For robotics - self learn and reproduction are super vital. The faster the cycle time and the more iterations the robots go through the better they become. With General Intelligence, this process can be sped up by an order of magnitude so the results will be fascinating.
