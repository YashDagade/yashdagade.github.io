3. This Essay
    
    We talked about Science and Diving. If we stop here - It seems like I am okay. I am not wide, I am deep. I need a phrase or something that will allow me to resonate with my application. 
    
    The principle will most likely talk about EyeDa. I have mentioned Research above but since NMSQT is for STEM - it only makes sense to talk more about Research. Now in talking about research I want to ensure that I highlight the following qualities: 
    
    1.  Charachter
        1. Hard Working, Kind, Curious
    2. Wisdom
        1. Conveyed enough but the words choice should be powerful and I should use a lot of 
            1. Use metonymy and synecdoche to ensure that the terms you use lign up with your vision
    3. Good will
        1. Similary use the correct tools
    
    So we know we want to talk about research - because principle (if I did my job right) will talk about EyeDa and he will cover aspects of my leadership so essay should be the next important thing to highlight.
    
    How about this letâ€™s tell a story that would highlight this perfectly
    
    1. I will talk about research and always wanting to do it alone
    2. Than I will talk about changing my mind and seeking help from anyone and everyone from graduate students to even my mom
    3. Finally I would talk about how this change taught me many things
    
    I can talk about how I changed my perspective when I realized that seeking help and collaborating are good. 
    
    (Not the best idea for National Merit considering that they pride themselves on individuality as an award)
    
    Letâ€™s instead do: 
    
    Research where I talk about getting burnt out and than finding the purpose of my research. It is to help others and for the fun of just doing science. 
    
    It should highlight the 3 traits of ethos - goodwill, disinterest, street smart. 
    
    It should also be touching and show character growth. The goal is to be personal so no need to nerd out about my research unless it is used to gain advantage on one of these 3 traits of ethos.

    **Pursuing Purpose Through the Power of Wind**
    
    In the quiet confines of my room, where the droning hum of my computer filled the air, I painstakingly analyzed every pixel on my screen. My tenth-grade self was neck-deep in Airborne Wind Energy Systems (AWEs) research, a topic that, at its core, was about harnessing untapped wind resources at high altitudes. The potential was thrilling, but the process was, frankly, grueling.
    
    As weeks turned into months, the initial excitement gradually waned, replaced by an overwhelming sense of fatigue and a nagging question: "Why am I doing this?" It wasn't the technical challenges of my project, SkyWindFarm, that were weighing on meâ€”though they were numerous. It was the isolation, the self-imposed confinement of working solo, fueled by my belief that true accomplishments were only born out of individual efforts.
    
    One evening, as I was brooding over another setback in my research, my mother gently knocked on my door. I hadn't discussed my research with her, assuming she wouldn't understand the intricacies of vertical axis wind turbines or computational fluid dynamics. Yet, as she sat beside me and I began explaining, I realized the core of my project wasn't in its technicalitiesâ€”it was in its purpose. She didn't need to understand the physics. She grasped the ambition, the potential impact, and most importantly, the weight it placed on my shoulders. "Yash," she said, "it's okay to lean on others sometimes. Your strength isn't just in what you know but also in recognizing when you need a fresh perspective."
    
    It was an epiphany. The next day, I started reaching outâ€”professors, graduate students, even peers. I wasn't just seeking technical help; I was looking for a renewed perspective, a reminder of why I began this journey. To my surprise, the more I opened up, the more I learned. Not just about AWEs, but about collaboration, communication, and humility.
    
    An encounter with a graduate student, who had worked in a remote village with minimal access to electricity, brought the 'why' into sharp focus. He spoke of children studying under dim lanterns and clinics unable to store vaccines due to erratic power supply. SkyWindFarm wasn't just about innovation. It was about empowerment, bringing change to communities like these.
    
    The shift in my approach was transformative. No longer was I a solitary researcher; I became part of a larger collective of innovators. It made the late nights, the hurdles, and the setbacks not just bearable but meaningful. They were no longer obstacles but stepping stones, shaping not just my project but my character.
    
    Now, when I reflect upon that journey, it's not the accolades or the accomplishments that stand out. It's the moment when I recognized that the real power of my research lay not in harnessing the wind, but in its potential to illuminate lives. The realization that I wasn't just creating an energy system, but potentially, a lifeline for remote communities, instilled in me a profound sense of purpose.
    
    The ethos of my project, and indeed my approach to challenges, mirrors the balance of individual pursuit and collaborative effort. In the vast field of research, it's easy to get lost in the 'what' and 'how'. But it's the 'why', underpinned by goodwill, informed judgment, and a genuine desire to make a difference, that lends true meaning to our endeavors.
    
    This journey through SkyWindFarm has been a testament to the transformative power of perspective. It has taught me that while individual passion ignites a dream, it's collective effort and understanding the deeper purpose that turn it into a reality.

**Harnessing the Wind, Illuminating Lives**

The hum of my computer was the soundtrack to my tenth-grade year, a constant backdrop to hours spent poring over data on Airborne Wind Energy Systems (AWEs). My ambition was clear: SkyWindFarm, a project aimed at harnessing untapped wind resources at high altitudes. Initially, my enthusiasm was boundless, but the solo grind soon took its toll. The thrill of innovation became clouded by isolation and a growing, nagging doubt: "Why am I even doing this?"

One evening, in the midst of my struggles, my mother entered my room. She may not have known the intricacies of my project, but she sensed my despair. "Yash," she gently said, "true strength isn't just about carrying the weight alone, but knowing when to share the load." It was a simple truth, one that reoriented my perspective. I had been so obsessed with individual achievement that I'd overlooked the power of collaboration.

The next morning marked a new chapter. I began reaching out to professors, peers, and graduate students. Their insights enhanced my work, leading to vital refinements in SkyWindFarm's design. For instance, a tip from a physics postgraduate led me to a novel aerodynamic discovery that allowed me to come up with a net zero power traversal for the Energy Farm.

However, the most pivotal interaction was with a graduate student who shared tales from his childhood in a remote village beleaguered by power shortages. He spoke not just of the challenges, but of what fueled his passion and gave his work purpose. Reflecting on his stories, I found my own purpose crystallizing. That night, as I lay in bed, a profound clarity washed over me. I envisioned a world where energy wasn't a privilege but a pervasive abundance. SkyWindFarm was no longer just an engineering project; it was a conduit for my newfound purpose: to transform our world into a place where energy scarcity is a relic of the past.

This journey imparted an invaluable lesson: while individual passion kindles innovation, it's collaboration and purpose that fuels true change. The crux of research isn't just the 'what' and 'how', but the profound 'why'. For me, that 'why' transcended technical achievement; it was about lighting up lives in the most literal sense.

In the quest to innovate, I discovered that the strength of an idea is amplified when shared. SkyWindFarm stands as testament to this truth. Not just as an engineering feat, but as a beacon of what's achievable when purpose and collaboration intertwine.
