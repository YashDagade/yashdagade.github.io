Easy to get in

The state itself is just slightly happier (guaranteed though) than reality

And getting out sucks

That‚Äôs true for many things, many addictions. In fact all addictions. 

Be it watching movies, T.V shows or alcohol or anything that is addictable. 

Let‚Äôs take watching movies as an example here.

I know watching YouTube is terrible, yet I somehow don‚Äôt take my own advice for this. It is because the decision to watch youtube is generally taken in a mood of high. Be it high of feeling super good and you must celebrate? by watching youtube.

üí° BTW, it‚Äôs just wrong to take a decision when in emotional highs. Taking decision in emotional high‚Äôs can only lead to bad, not good. There is a very simple distinction between being adventurous and being high. You are scared when adventurous, scared for yourself in the future, not true when you are high.  When high, your feelings for present outweigh future feelings.

So you get in. It is easy to get in. Totally opposite of how getting to gym may be, high initial cost. 

<aside>
üí° BTW - healthy habits, kind of are the opposite to addictions. Hard to get in, not always ‚Äúenjoyable‚Äù in the process but feel wonderful getting out. Anywho, I digress - it‚Äôs time to celebrate so..,

Than, you enter the watching period. 

At no time, are you feeling euphoric. But at the same time the penalty to stop watching is quite high. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, you are not feeling bad either. It‚Äôs still kind of terrible. But you are not feeling great. You just know that going out is going to be terrible. 

So the only natural thing to do is keep watching because the cost for the next step is too high. If our body is optimizing for minimum cost at the next step instead of the next few steps, than we will continue paying the cost of watching without quitting for a long long time. Which is usually the case.

Than once you do stop, you feel terrible. And you predicted that. The hangover phase is BAD. There are only two options now, do the thing that every cell in your body insists you don‚Äôt do and go touch grass, talk to others and get back up healthier than before.

Or relapse‚Ä¶ keep watching again, because it is better than this reality.

And so goes the cycle. 

This is true for many things. The key to addictions isn‚Äôt the euphoria it‚Äôs the penalty. That‚Äôs what makes them successful. The penalty of getting out is what makes addiction so powerful for human brains. Because as humans we are only scared of bad. We like the good, but that is not as big of a motivator, at least an order of magnitude less so, than bad, or so I hypothesize. 

And I would assume this is true for YouTube, Smoking, Alchool, all the drugs. 

One way I have found success in getting out of these ‚Äúbrain dead‚Äù living on the ‚Äúavoiding the hit‚Äù zone is by first recognizing when I am taking decisions in a high. 

It is so easy to take a high decision, but it is not good. Adventure is key, taking decisions when high is not adventure. It is not curiosity, it is being brain dead. 

Another way is to force yourself out to touch grass. To go to bed, to do anything but watch youtube. See youtube by itself isn‚Äôt bad, but the addiction definitely is. 

Few more things‚Ä¶

1. I haven‚Äôt fully figured it out yet. And in someways that is kind of expected. I believe it is a natural thing for us humans to embrace the ‚Äúslow negetivity‚Äù because it is the opposite of unexpected, and we are okay with being in a slow doomed future than an unpredictable but utopian future
2. Recognizing the addiction cycle is probably one of the most important things to do if we want to get out of it

üí° Addictions are addictions not because the addiction state is euphoric but because ‚Äúgetting in‚Äù is super easy, while in it, it‚Äôs not too bad (not good at all though), but the penalty to get out is very high. This is true for all addictions.
