# What we owe the future

Since these are personal blogs, I have to start by acknowledging that (-) in general is way more representative than (+); and the comment of weather that is a good thing or not - I am unsure off. 

So having said that I fundamentally disagree with the statement that “innovation” gets harder as our knowledge capacity increases. 

That’s simply not true!

Why? Because - first we simply innovate more with more resources. We will always have new frontiers to explore. We will never run out of things to explore. We will never run out of math to play with or numbers to discover .

And to anyone living in the present, it always seems like the new math is radical and useless and the new physics is expensive and borderline fiction. But that’s true for all generations. If something is not radical, it would have been done before. 

The universe is vast and the tools we innovate on get greater as we create more tools.

So - yes we will live in an exponential curve - not a logarithmic one that MacAskill suggests.

Having said that - we are responsible for the future. We as humanity have the power to shape the future and we should take great interest in making sure that the future is a place where people have lesser friction to creative freedom than ever before. That’s the purpose of life - to ensure that the future has a lesser friction to creative freedom. 

And this book definitely resonated with that. 

Impact matters more than emotion. 

Future matters just as much as present.

You can change this world; you can influence it. 

That’s all! good book :D

Lessons Learned:

1. Humanity is still a young species! The average lifespan of a mammalian species is around 1 million years. We have been around for less than 10,000 years, that only one percent!
2. Humanity may right now just be in it’s clay state, now is the right time to mold it in a way - or at least set some principlies up that will guide the future
3. Most of the innovations, from cellphones to the rankine cycles to all the tools we use today occur in less than 5 generations. The world in 1500 was quite basic. We are in an exponential trend, and a steep one. A rough estimate for innovation is 1.02^x^1.1
    1. With time innovation increases and the rate of change of increase increases - In 500 years, we are speaking a growth of about 100 million. 
4. We are blind! In many ways - just as our founding fathers were blind when they wrote the declaring of independence while still having women not able to vote and solves that only count for 3/5ths human. Just like that we are blind - we don’t know the horrors that animals go through for a meal’s sake. We kill in the order of billions of fishes, goats, cows, hens among others. And we brutally kill them for only one minute pleasure that we experience. That is horrible! Yet most people are okay with it :( 
5. A lot can and will change within our lifetimes and we, yes the person writing and reading this, has a lot of power to change it. Change it for the better. Because remember, we are very young right now and now is the most important time to get things right. We can become multiplanetary or multi galxiacal and the values we set in today can quite literally be universally accepted. It’s time to start making this universe better
