# Swimming in the Ocean

Date: March 7, 2024

This is inspired by the phrase that the young fish tell the old fish “ I wanna swim in the ocean”

The old fish says “you are in the ocean”

The young fish says “no this isn’t ocean this is just water”

As I think about this- I realize how much I am limiting my self - and so many in the world are too from so g what they want to do.

I know it’s limiting yourself when the thought process goes like- I will do this when I get this done- like I will start a company after I go to a good college.

That’s just a waste of time and that company is never gonna start. Because I will find another reason to postpone it.

The startup culture in cali is no different than the one in Minnesota- it’s still all just water- so there is no reason to wait. 

Start now!
