# Non Sibi (For Others)

Advice on what not to do - 

Don’t be a follower, be a leader. I was a die hard follower for Achutya and that’s just wrong. Don’t do that. There are boundaries. 

Respect the boundaries. Also I will have way more followers and way more important people following me in the future. But let’s think about it. Why does it matter. What difference does it make. 

None!

Regardless of who does or doesn’t follow me, the world doesn’t become more productive. To increase the net productivity of the world, the question should not be who follows me - it should be how can I help the world. 

And when thinking like that - it does not matter. Aim for impact, don’t aim for fame. Fame does not stick to the passage of time, it is a temporary stage. Impact is not. 

**Non sibi** means 'not for oneself', that is, one should contribute to the common good.

That should be the goal!
