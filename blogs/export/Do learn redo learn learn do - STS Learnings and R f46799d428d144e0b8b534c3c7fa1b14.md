# Do learn redo >> learn learn do - STS Learnings and Reflections

Tags: Start Here

I still feel bad. It is  February 8, 2024 —over 15 days and 14 hours—and I still can't seem to find a smile within me. This has been a loss that has stuck with me the longest. I still feel the pain every day, and I am still not able to look at the top 40 list without getting at least a little sad.

You know what, though? I am happy for all the 40 people; they were deserving of that award, and they needed it. I feel like I let our year down, sort of. I made a mistake in our title. I had decent essays, but all of them were very modest things. Things that could have been easily overlooked—they were not a make-or-break kind of deal. But combined, they were enough to break the application. Combined, they show a person who is not prepared and does everything—but only does everything okay. That is not the person I want to be.

I looked at some other peers and realized the following things: Kevin had all his forms printed by November 27—almost 6 months prior to the fairs. All the forms 1C, he had all the posters done by then as well. So is true for Natasha and true for the $20,000 winner.

All of this shows one thing: excellence is never baked at the 11th hour.

Yet somehow, I can't get past that. I can't get past doing everything at the last minute.

Honestly, this is how things go. This is how they went for ISEF last year, STS, college apps, among other things.

I always knew I had a lot to do—but here is how I spent my time. 

I would NOT waste my time; at that time, if you were to ask me how I felt about the work done, I would have said—It was meaningful. And to be honest, it was.

BUT this process was WRONG.

I would—for example, for STS—a month out from STS, research everything about the top 40—look at what they did. Look at all the YouTube videos and seminars for the top 40 guys. I would look at all the past years' seminars too. I would contact Emily Ocasio and I would do everything in my power to learn more about the previous years' finalists.

I would analyze trends. I would see what worked last year and try to fit myself into that picture.

By the time I had submitted my STS application last year, I knew the names and high schools of all the finalists and I knew what their projects were on and why they were most likely chosen to be a finalist. For Emily, it was her personality not her research; for Kevin, it was because he was Kevin; for Neel, it was his research and a bit of personality.

I would know all of this yet when it came to actually produce a paper, I had nothing. I would spend time researching others and not doing my own. I would spend too much time comparing myself to others when I had nothing to compare against.

I had not even started all the essays and hadn't written a single word for all the questions. I did not spend a lot of time thinking about how to present my awards and activities. All of them were submitted at iteration one.

Not iteration 10, not even iteration 2, just iteration one. They had a lot of—A LOT OF—mistakes. What that ended up producing was a bad outcome; it was certainly not the worst, but it was bad. 

And I wasted a lot of time.

A BETTER way to do it would have been to, instead of spending all the time looking at others, first, before even looking at what others have done, just fill out the entire application. Seriously, it only takes less than 5 hours, I bet. And then, and only then, start to think about what others have done and iterate like that.

I did too much planning about what I would put in respective fields but I never put it there until the last minute. Instead of first putting it there and then looking at what others have done and iterating like that.

The main advantage that this has is that it allows you to basically submit at iteration 10+ and the quality of the application at that point is truly exceptional. That was not the case for me. I had too many mistakes in my own application for it to be anything useful.

So this was a very EXPENSIVE lesson. But I now carry this lesson with me to the future. When working on an application, a paper, a test, or a presentation, instead of learning everything about that “thing,” I will now first do a first draft. It’s okay if it is very bad.

Neural networks don’t start by giving the perfect weights and then tweaking them; they start with random alignment and multiple iterations.

I will do the same, create a draft, then run these evaluations, then look at the seminars and see what they have to say, then look at everything else and iterate.

I would then have a north star, a very short, easily remembered north star to shoot for. I would have a good evaluation function, but at the same time, I would have a great model as well.

So far, I have a great eval function, but a bad model because surprise surprise, I have only gone through a single iteration and it is not that good.

So that is the learning. I will summarize it as first do, then learn, then redo. Instead of learn, then do.

**Do, learn, redo >> learn, learn, do**

You don’t need a lot of learning for a good evaluation function, and the amount of training required to get a great evaluation function isn’t that much. I did not need to look at this year's and last year's and look at all the LinkedIn pages of all the finalists; had I only taken this year's learnings, I would have still had a similar judgment for what I need.

And the newly allocated—around 60% of my time given for STS—would instead of going towards learning about it have gone towards making my application better and stronger.

So that is my learning.

It was expensive to learn, but as mentioned before, I will carry this throughout my life.

Here it is in bullet points:

- Create a first draft before learning about others.
- Creating good judgment takes less time than I think it does.
- Creating a good application takes at least 6 iterations—always more than what I think it does.
- Go over multiple model iterations, not learning iterations.
