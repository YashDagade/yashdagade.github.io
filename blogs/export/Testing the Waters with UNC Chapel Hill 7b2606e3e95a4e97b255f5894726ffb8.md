The reason I want to apply to this college - mainly to test the waters and get myself mentally prepared for how ready I am for colleges and how the application pool

Essay 1 Answer:

Empathy has always been a driving force for me, especially when it comes to problem-solving. I learned this attribute's real-world significance when it led me to tackle a problem that has caused many tragedies: distracted driving. This issue hit close to home when my aunt was severely injured in an accident caused by a distracted driver, impacting her ability to walk and speak. The experience left a lasting impression on me.

In response, I founded EyeDa—a tech-driven initiative aimed at curbing distracted driving. But what began as a simple idea quickly gained traction, evolving into a collective endeavor. I led a team of over 20 like-minded individuals, each contributing diverse skills. Together, we developed innovative solutions, such as our Safe Routes algorithm, which suggests safer driving routes based on historical accident data. We also created EyeDa PCB, a machine-learning based device that detects driver distraction using sound and IMU data from the car.

Our efforts caught the attention of both local and state media. We were featured on ABC, Fox News, NBC, and in newspapers like the Star Tribune. Committed to public safety, we open-sourced all our code, CAD files, PCB design files, and our IP to maximize its reach and impact.

EyeDa taught me how empathy can fuel meaningful change. It guided not just the challenges I tackled, but how I approached them. At Carolina, I aim to continue applying this empathetic lens to use technology as a catalyst for positive impact.

Essay 2 Answer:

Getting computers to do things for me has been a joy that I love chasing. When I was little, I would help my mom during her Ph.D by learning macros in excel and helping my mom do much of the repetitive tasks that she would spend hours doing on her own. Watching the joy in my mom’s eyes as she would see the computer help her would make smile from ear to ear.

I love automating machines. From creating a custom keyboard shortcut that prints “public static void main(string args)” whenever I am in VS code to optimizing and automating the BEM code at SAFL labs at the UofMN I love to automate stuff.

My friends call me an automation freak, after watching me spend countless hours trying to automate a task that simply takes just a few moments. During COVID, I created a device I call "thermometer on wheels," which measures your temperature whenever you enter the room. I spent three months building this robot, and some quick calculations revealed that the payback time would be a mere 14 years, optimal in my books ;)

I can't wait to dive deeper into the world of automation through computer science at UNC Chapel Hill. My endearing quest for automation isn't merely about the fascination of getting computers to perform tasks but aims to contribute meaningfully to society. I look forward to honing my skills to automate complex problems, drive efficiency, and make the world a more productive place.
