# Top 40

Date: January 12, 2024

It’s not about me. It’s about hope.

See my application has many things going for it - let’s check the AI thing once again but I think I will be top 40 because I have EyeDa. I do have some typos but they are all good and guess what, I have really good essays, hard courses, everything is good. 

Also the research is good. GREAT! Actually!

The Recs are great! Except dixit possibly the rest are GREAT!

Now it comes to all the technical essays- they are great too! And so are the non technical ones! The fact that I have an essay on purpose- honestly some say it was one of the best essays I have written. 

My essay on running and smiling is probably one of the most humane essays I have written so far. It is also very good and highlights the human behind the work. 

Some potential problems

1. I say we have 20 vijay says 8 that is a problem
2. I say winner of JSHS - I guess it is not technically wrong because I didn’t say national, I meant tri state, but I guess it doesn’t matter

Okay to be honest, those problems are minute and every time I look at the STS application it feel reliving. It feels strong it feels good. STS wants leaders in STEM, I show that, how

1. Patent
2. Publish
3. Great Quality Research
4. EyeDa - message well conceived that I created a research group after personal reasons
5. Awards and Honors
6. Hard Courses taken and taking that are impressive

This is the exact kind of thing they are looking for and they will definitely pick me I am so sure of it! 

See I will get top 40 - It will be Yash Dagade, son of vaishali dagade is the founder of EyeDa, a research initiative he founded to end distracted driving. He is also a robotics mentor and volunteers at the Airplane restoration group. 

He is a diver and has a patent!  

See I think I will be a top 40 finalist because I do have everything needed to be there!

Okay so we do have the research report that is top notch! Recs are great! Transcript really good! Core application is strong! all the activities are good!

They say their selection riterio is strength of research through other scientific merit- Getting a patent, doing LLJ research, national merit semifainalist are all great examples actually of this!

Student Contribution is a lot! Academic aptitude is high! Potential for future leader is EyeDa!

First thing they say is we are not looking for perfection! I don’t have that so that is actually a + it humanizes me and shows faliure side of me. Also USNCO 5th in state for academic aptitude and ancheivment too!

You know what - they are prolly not going to be fact checking and technically I was never wrong so we are good about JSHS!!!

Great job. Plus if they pick Davidson fellow they are bound to pick a JSHS winner too so nothing to worry about.

I think we got top 40 easy!
