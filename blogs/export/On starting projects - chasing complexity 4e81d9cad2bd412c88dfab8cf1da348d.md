# On starting projects - chasing complexity

Date: June 7, 2024

The thing is that - many times the initial idea for starting a project weather for research or more relevantly industry- ends up being wrong or already explored and unsuccessful. It’s so hard to work on the same problem after that realization. 

But something’s clearly wrong. Because you had a problem and you didn’t find a solution for it, and that’s why you started.

And that empirical evidence is kinda huge. If it bothers you - it bothers others too so Dixie n that problem is good.

The right way to start is to not even think about money.  You should only expect a few builds out of the many you build to be cash cows. Most of the other builds should be - simply said- done for good karma.

The great thing about building for good karma and not building a startup is also that up end up doing more good karma. You end up making many of the right decisions that majority of the startups fail to make. The right way to start a start up is to find an annoying problem- and just solve it. Not for money but for doing your part in making this world a wonderful place.

Have it be a side project meant to help others- it doesn’t mater if it’s a gpt wrapper - if it helps others than it’s worth budling. Don’t worry about novelty or effecienvy if your users are not worrying about it.

Your goal is to serve humanity and if a wrapper does it than so be it.

Once you start satisfying customers- that’s it’s a good idea to optimize the satisfaction metric. Not the growth metric, let that come naturally, it doesn’t matter if it doesn’t grow. 

Don’t force it- that signal is provably a blessing in disguise. 

Only when you think that improving satisfaction requires you to build something no one else has built, should u chase novelty.

Only after  you are unsatisfied by the current sota should you worry about making more.
