Writing one 650 word essay every day for 1 month straight - That is it. No caveats. I will find interesting prompts and nice titles for all of them too.

For them to be actually good though, someone should probably review them and give me feedback on them and I canâ€™t think about a better person for this job than Hansen. I bet she will love to do this.
