<p>Education is natural - schooling is artificial.</p>
<p>I love to learn. I promise every one does. We all have the inert curiysoity to question. To question anything and everything. A good education should ideally make us a better questioner not a better answerer. Answers are often more boring than questions are. Knowledge is more lame, Discovery is fun. </p>
<p>Our policies on academic dishonesty make me feel kind of sad. We label people based on how good they do on tests - As, Bs, Cs, Ds, Fs. The thought process is bad - the undiscovered advantage of this is the learning of discipline and a motive to do more. A motive to chase. A motive to focus. </p>
<p>I believe there is a reason why people with good grades often succeed, it is because grades are a good measure of focus. However, they are not important. The indicator measures not importance but the ability to work under pressure and to focus which is important. </p>
<p>And that’s why for many of the people grades are not a problem. They are a problem for the procrastinator turned nocastinators who chose not to do stuff. They are a problem for those of us who don’t like to follow commands. They hurt these focus groups quite a bit.</p>
