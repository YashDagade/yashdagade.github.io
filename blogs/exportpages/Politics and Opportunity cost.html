        <h1>Politics and Opportunity cost</h1>

<p>I hope to stray away from the mainstrem news events - mainly because of the opportunity cost. See, I have had this opinion for a while now and I still agree to it. It is - </p>
<p>Donâ€™t bother</p>
<p>See the next president of the united states will have a good deal off impact on your life. But for anything to be worth thinking off, it needs to qualify of these 3 things</p>
<ol>
<li>How important is it?</li>
<li>Can you do something about it? If yes at what cost?</li>
<li>And what opportunity cost</li>
</ol>
<p>Question one in itself doesn't mean much but ties into the importance of question three. See at this point, politics is just entertainment for all of us. The opportunity cost to discuss politics is quite low and there is no reason to be involved in the talks. Because you can always solve better problems. Always.</p>
<p>Learn a new instrument. Deepen your love for math. Do other things - other non-brain dead things that make you feel active and accomplished later.</p>
