<p>We lose with an abusive male figure who I regrettably have to refer to as family sometimes. The way this works out is this- </p>
<ol>
<li>I get into MIT, Stanford or Harvard</li>
<li>I get scholarships or take my own student debt (or go debt free)</li>
<li>We leave the idiot </li>
<li>We go change the world </li>
</ol>
<p>Key for me will be scholarships or student loans and once mom gets in we can even share the loan with mom and pay it off very quickly.</p>
<p>I think I can get a full ride too and I can build a good support base around me to ensure that I do. Once I do become rich and kind of famous and mom becomes a billionaire, I will consider this world to be fair.</p>
