ðŸ’¡ The essay itself:

"What is hard?" was the first question I asked my mom after she finished the bed time story for my 3rd grade birth day. The answer forces you to -- well I will complete that sentence at the end of the essay. However, to start let me frame my question correctly. The life of Tim Cook and the life of the Chinese assembler assembling the iPhone are both difficult but in very different ways? While the factory worker does a lot of "hard" work, the decision Tim makes carries a lot more responsibility. However, let's delve deeper, is the work that the factory worker doing really hard, is it hard to do repetitive task 6 hours a day, 7 days a week. No, it is repetitive and boring but not hard. Neither is it hard to make decisions when you have an entire team dedicated to that. You are just the face of those decisions - it is a skill, not "hard". Nothing in this word is hard, you will find a person who will love to do the thing that you think is hard and nothing is easy either. You will find people who will struggle with things that you think are super easy. Like knowing how to use Ansys is quite easy but I am sure that the factory worker will disagree with me. While lifting a lot of weight is hard for me. A word2Vec approach on hard would also result in words synonoumus to pain, however pain in itself happens based on the chemical hormones released that only respond to change.

Change, change is hard. Uncertainty is hard, we like to have predictable paths. I love giving pep talks and one of my favorite pep talks is one where I talk about uncertainty. In uncertain times, a human would rather assume the worst possible outcome to be true and plan their life around that outcome, unurpsingly leading them to a place where they end up at that outcome that they spend so much time planning for and the cycle continues to -âˆž.

However, the change is a weird paradox in that life without change is boring. While change can be scary, not change can be depressing. And when it comes to predictability, your life is unpredictable. Want a proof, you don't know what your next though is going to be. Your thoughts are not predictable at all, you don't know what you think next, no body knows!

All of that to say that the notion of hard is best described by ambiguity. With that, I love to do things that I think are hard. It is just one of the things that I have trained my self to enjoy. Case in point - diving - why would any one risk their lives always being millimeters away from death, to do meaning less flips in air and landing in freezing cold waters for people to see? I didn't know yet when I was given the chance to join the dive team, I said yes. Just to push my limits, and that decision probably made me a way better person than I would have been had I not taken that decision.

Loving hard things also means that nothing in this world seems unachievable. I mean it, anything that I want to do I can do. You just need a plan for it. One of the main ways in which the hard work that the factory worker did differs from the handwork that Tim Cook did was the amount of time they spent on planning to do that work. Tim Cook spent more time planning that work than doing that work, while the factory worker spend so much more time doing that work than asking questions about why he should do that work. Planning is super important to, it is important to ask yourself questions and always requisition, rethink and refocus your priorities. Change is important, not scary. What seems like the status quo today is made by similar people to you, and what they did at their time seems equally dumb and crazy as to what you are about to do. Don't be scared by crazy things, or scary things. Rather be scared if you are doing something that doesn't seem crazy. It probably is not worth your attention. That's why I think starting a company in a "competitive" landscape is worth the risk - introducing EyeDa. A company that I started with teenagers that is now selling solutions to insurance companies.

<p>This is the unfiltered version - however I will make second Yash work on it and than paste the filters 650 word version below. </p>

ðŸ’¡ Prompt for second Yash:

Ensure that the essay reads like I wrote it. After reading the essay, the reader should feel like I am an observant person who likes to observe and ask questions - regarding everything in life. They should also feel like I am a chill person who never gets stressed. Finally they should feel like I love to challenge myself simply for the fun of it.

I want the essay itself to be on these rough notions:

Your Mindset matters a lot

Nothing is hard

Planning is important

People just like you make the status quo

The personal statement should be within 650 words - below is my rough unfiltered draft of how I wrote the essay - modify it such that it achieves the goals mentioned above. It should be elegant to read and should have aha moments that make the reader realize just how well the text is written.

Generic college essay tip - **Don't just recountâ€”reflect!**

Anyone can write about how they won the big game or the summer they spent in Rome. When recalling these events, you need to give more than the play-by-play or itinerary. Describe what you learned from the experience and how it changed you.

ðŸ’¡ **Title: Chasing Ambiguity: The Joy in Embracing Life's Uncertainties**

"What is hard?" I posed this question to my mom at the end of a bedtime story on my 3rd-grade birthday. I'll tell you her answer, but first, let's unpack the question. In contrasting roles, say between Tim Cook and a factory assembler, the term 'hard' takes on different meanings. For the factory worker, assembling iPhones might appear repetitive, even monotonous, but not necessarily hard. For Tim Cook, the decisions he makes hold significant weight, yet with a skilled team behind him, can we call his role hard? The variable is perspective, really. What might be a cakewalk for you could be an uphill battle for someone else.

Life is full of contradictions, and one of the most glaring is our relationship with change. Itâ€™s the paradox of human existence: we fear uncertainty yet detest monotony. Our thoughts themselves are unpredictableâ€”try guessing your next one. Go ahead; I'll wait. See? A series of electrochemical reactions in your brain can be more surprising than you think.

So, what's truly hard? Ambiguity. The not knowing, the uncertain paths, and the volatile outcomesâ€”these are the universal hard spots of life. But here's my personal twist: I relish ambiguity. Let's talk diving, for instance. Why would anyone willingly put their life on the line to perform mid-air flips into freezing waters? I couldn't answer that, but when the opportunity arose to join the diving team, I took it. Why? To challenge the boundaries of my comfort zone. I wasnâ€™t sure if Iâ€™d land face-first into failure, but the thrill was in the trying, and that in itself enriched my life in ways I couldnâ€™t have imagined.

This brings me to a pivotal philosophy: planning. In the debate between Tim Cook and the factory worker, the striking difference is planning. Tim Cook doesnâ€™t just work; he works on a plan, backed by years of knowledge and an unyielding team. Thereâ€™s a sophisticated choreography to what seems like intuitive decisions. That's what I strive for, too. Constant questioning, rethinking, and refocusing sharpen my roadmap, making the ambiguous a thrilling challenge rather than an insurmountable obstacle.

But what about breaking the status quo? When something appears risky or "competitive," I see a playground of opportunities. Take EyeDa, a company I founded with a group of like-minded teenagers. We're collaborating with leading insurance companies to secure their fleets, a venture many would consider audacious for our age. The status quo? Thatâ€™s set by people just like you and me. If they could leap into what seemed "crazy" at their time, why shouldnâ€™t we?

So, what did my mom say when 3rd-grade me asked, "What is hard?" She looked at me and said, "Hard is what you make of it, but remember, you can make it easier with the right mindset, the right plan, and the courage to challenge the norm." It turns out she was right all along.

Now, if you've ever wondered why someone might chase falling leaves in a Minnesotan autumn, perform flips over a diving board, or even start a company in their teens, the answer is simple: for the joy of embracing life's beautiful uncertainties. I don't dread the 'hard'; I look it straight in the eye and see it for what it is: a wonderfully ambiguous puzzle, asking to be solved. And who could resist that?
