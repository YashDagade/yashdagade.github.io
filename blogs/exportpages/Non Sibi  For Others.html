<p>Advice on what not to do - </p>
<p>Don’t be a follower, be a leader. I was a die hard follower for Achutya and that’s just wrong. Don’t do that. There are boundaries. </p>
<p>Respect the boundaries. Also I will have way more followers and way more important people following me in the future. But let’s think about it. Why does it matter. What difference does it make. </p>
<p>None!</p>
<p>Regardless of who does or doesn’t follow me, the world doesn’t become more productive. To increase the net productivity of the world, the question should not be who follows me - it should be how can I help the world. </p>
<p>And when thinking like that - it does not matter. Aim for impact, don’t aim for fame. Fame does not stick to the passage of time, it is a temporary stage. Impact is not. </p>
<p><strong>Non sibi</strong> means 'not for oneself', that is, one should contribute to the common good.</p>
<p>That should be the goal!</p>
