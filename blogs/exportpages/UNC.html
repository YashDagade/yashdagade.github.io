<p>Okay - Let‚Äôs think like this - We have shown research, we have shown EyeDa. For research we have patents, papers and accolades. For EyeDa we have nothing. So Let‚Äôs focus on EyeDa for now. </p>
<p>Let‚Äôs do UNC today since they are due October 15</p>
<p>We‚Äôd like to know how you‚Äôd contribute to the Carolina community and ask that you respond to each prompt in up to 250 words.</p>
<ol>
<li>Discuss one of your personal qualities and share a story, anecdote, or memory of how it helped you make a positive impact on a community. This could be your current community or another community you have engaged.</li>
</ol>
<aside>
üí° Pre thinking on what to write about: 

they ask for positive impact on community  - We can talk about EyeDa though the impact may be minimal. Let‚Äôs see how can we measure impact

We can talk about my dive carrier though it may take a lot of context to land, however UNC is easy and the next prompt already talks about using CS so let‚Äôs talk about coding and stuff

<p>I know the effects of distracted driving first hand as one of my aunts got into a life changing accidents. She lost the ability to walk and speak properly and couldn‚Äôt be employed anymore.</p>
<p>So when I had the opportunity to meet with Mr.Dixit, whose daughter was lost to a distracted driver, I knew I wanted to help. I know the pains involved with drowsy and reckless driving and I know that for problems like these the obvious solution has to be </p>
<p>That‚Äôs why I created EyeDa, an initiative focused on using technology to help drivers drive attentively and make the roads a safer place.</p>
<p>What started as a simple initiative in my mind quickly transformed into a group of over 20 people with the same vision and a whole suit of different technologies to help execute that vision. From our proprietary Safe Routs algorithm, that suggests safer routes to all the drivers based on the accident data of previous car accidents while also helping identify roads that are inherently built to be more unsafe to hardware solutions like EyeDa PCB that use a novel machine learning architecture to identify driver distraction simply based on the sound and IMU data of the car.</p>
<p>Our work was well received by everyone, from local news to state wise television channels, we were featured in ABC, Fox News, NBC and News Paper like the Star Tribune. We open sourced all our code to make our technology widely accessibly and help save lives. </p>

<li>Discuss an academic topic that you‚Äôre excited to explore and learn more about in college. Why does this topic interest you? Topics could be a specific course of study, research interests, or any other area related to your academic experience in college.</li>

üí° Either CS or ME - CS is competitive but UNC is easy to get in so let‚Äôs go with CS

<p>Getting computers to do things for me has been a joy that I love chasing. When I was little, I would help my mom during her Ph.D by learning macros in excel and helping my mom do much of the repetitive tasks that she would spend hours doing on her own. Watching the joy in my mom‚Äôs eyes as she would see the computer help her would make smile from ear to ear. </p>
<p>I love automating machines. From creating a custom keyboard shortcut that prints ‚Äúpublic static void main(string args)‚Äù whenever I am in VS code to optimizing and automating the BEM code at SAFL labs at the UofMN I love to automate stuff. </p>
<p>My friends call me an automation freak, after watching me spend countless hours trying to automate a task that simply takes just a few moments. Like during covid - I made a thermometer on wheels for a lack of better word that just measures your temperatures whenever you enter the room. The amount of time I spent making this robot was 3 months which after some quick napkin math yields the payback time to be only 14 years. </p>
<p>I can't wait to dive deeper into the world of automation through computer science at UNC Chapel Hill. My endearing quest for automation isn't merely about the fascination of getting computers to perform tasks but aims to contribute meaningfully to society. I look forward to honing my skills to automate complex problems, drive efficiency, and make the world a more productive place.</p>

üí° High Insight - That‚Äôs pretty good 250 words on the dot!
