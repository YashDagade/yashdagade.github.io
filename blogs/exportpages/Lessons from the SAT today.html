        <p>Ok I am just going to write what’s in my mind. Let’s start with how o felt the test went. I think I did ok in English. The vocabulary question I am not sure about because they used different vocabulary. I still think it went okay though. I did get one wrong though and that was the writing one, what do the two texts think about each other. I also have think I got the nature one wrong because the nature one I didn’t know the meaning of two of the words. </p>
<p>For math. First section went good. Second section I made an unfordable mistake I got too confident and started getting slow with all the math questions. At least I had the brain to jump ahead and get to the hard questions. That’s when I realized that they are wiwrions that would actually love to get the time that I give them and all off a sudden I had to rush. I probably got 3 wrong I can’t exactly think straight</p>
<p>Both of them were purely based on time that I wasted before. Had I had more time I would have gotten a perfect math score. I know o didn’t and it is because of a silly math mistake o prolly got a 790 or 780 but the scoring also can be mean and I may end up getting a score like 750 as has happened in practice tests.</p>
<p>english I may actually end up getting like a 760 or even like a 780 depending on the guesses. It all kind of unfortunately does downed on luck at this point </p>
<p>I feel sad, because I know I could have gotten a better score had I been more prudent but my imprudence will lead me ultimately to the score that I get. </p>
