<p>I don’t know, khushi came today and it was kind of not what I expected at all. Firstly, I did not feel anything for her. Secondly, I don’t get the same “excellence” vibes that I used to get from her. I learned she did not always go to level two for math or science, only english and that she started taking running seriously since 6th grade. She is also planning to do college for class of 29, so has like another year or so. I was to be honest, not at all impressed. </p>
<p>Talking to her, I also forgot what I wanted to say and whatever was on the list did mainly get all answered. She also did not reach back to me after leaving. Not sure why? Also she dosen’t exactly have a great reputation for me. </p>
<p>She is a top 10 athlete in the continent, but like yeah. Great possible. Am I top 10 in continent, NO! But still I wasn’t exactly happy. Kind of to be honest I feel empty. This feels like the end of my child hood crush era. I now move on to be a man who is 10x more productive thanks to being laser focused. </p>
<p>Yes. She is more impressive than me, but I am afraid still lacks the winning attitude. That is a must, she was the sports captain, 7th in Poddar and top 10 in the world. I want to be with someone who would be top 1. I want to be top 1 too. I think I can be. I want to do IIT just because i think it is a great mental exercise. </p>
<p>I deeply respect her and hope to stay acquainted with her for the rest of my life. Amazing amazing person, kind of ended up in the best possible scenario. Optimizing productivity and making the future a</p>
