<h3>General - 1 x 350</h3>
<ol>
<li>In the aftermath of the U.S. Civil War, Ezra Cornell wrote, "I would found an institution where any person can find instruction in any study." For over 150 years, Cornell University has remained deeply committed to Ezra‚Äôs vision. Explain how your life experiences will help inform your contributions to a learning community devoted to ‚Äú...any person‚Ä¶any study.‚Äù We encourage you to think broadly about your life experiences, including how local (e.g., family, school, neighborhood) or global communities you‚Äôve been part of have helped shape your perspective.*<ol>
<li>How will you meaningfully contribute to a community devoted to ‚Äúany person and or any study‚Äù<ol>
<li>Perhaps I can say I hope that at cornell I will learn both CS + ME</li>
<li>I can talk about how Dr.Biswas and Professors here have taken me into their tuttlage and I hope to do the same at cornell. I</li>

<h2>College Specific - Engineering - They want to know why cornell - so name drop as much as you can?</h2>
<h3>Essay 1: Required response. (250-word limit)</h3>
<p>How do your interests directly connect with Cornell Engineering? If you have an intended major, what draws you to that department at Cornell Engineering? If you are unsure what specific engineering field you would like to study, describe how your general interest in engineering most directly connects with Cornell Engineering. It may be helpful to concentrate on one or two things that you are most excited about.</p>
<ul>
<li>energy and SkyWindFarm</li>
<li>Why cornell basically - answer it like so:<ul>
<li>Perhaps we can write this as a blog too in 250 words.</li>
<li>Rebecaa bethaline has done some work that I hope to use - Emailed her and talk</li>
<li>Cornell has a lot of wind energy resources</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Why Cornell - aligned with the mission of energy or the mission of solving great problems - now add all the program names and all faculty name for cornell</p>
<h3>Essay 2: Choose either Question A and Question B. (250-word limit)</h3>
<p><strong>Question A:</strong>¬†Describe an engineering problem that impacts your local community. This could be your school, neighborhood, town, region, or a group you identify with. Describe one to three things you might do as an engineer to solve the problem.</p>
<p>EyeDa Problem. Start by saying - </p>
<p>I love engineering because it teaches us problem solving. As a future cornell engineer, I hope to make some strides in making the roads safer. I lost my aunt to DD, which lead me to build EyeDa. However with a cornell engineering bachelors, I hope I can take larger strides in solving distracted driving.  After taking classes such as ___ or ___  and working with Prof ___ I hope to build a system that will enable me to ensure that this problem is not as prevalent and not more people suffer from that problem already. </p>
<p>Email Cornell about this question and the tense - like something we will do after we graduate as an engineer or something we are doing right now </p>
<p>For the General Question: </p>
<p>The quote is this: Any person can study any subject</p>
<p>The main highlight of the quote Is to show any person any subject. Remove all barriers. It seems like the college would really care for a diverse background. </p>
<p>Okay let‚Äôs just jabber about what comes to mind and than we can go from there: </p>
<aside>
üí° Any Person Any study. How will I contribute to an evnorincment that focuses on any person any study. Well for starters, I am a persona and secondly, just today while buying Diet Coke I realized they have zero sugar. So than I decided to delve deeper into the idea of how Diet Coke, the thing that tastes almost exactly like coke can have zero sugars. I even read one of the prominent papers on this field to realize that calories are just what you absorb, so the way to get zero calories is just to provide the body with un absorbable sugar. Not the best decision. 

However, the main reason I bring this idea up - is because I fundamentally believe that all of us should embrace our curiosity. We tend to get a notion that as you grow up things are the way they are, don‚Äôt try to change them. Focus on your field of study, don‚Äôt see yourself too thin. I want to challenge that vision. 

I do believe in the art of focusing, it‚Äôs kind of like the power of fluid going through a nozzle. The power is proportional to velocity cubed, which is inversely proportional to area squared. The lesser the area you target, the cubically greater the power you get. So it is important to be focused, but at the same time it is also important to be curious. These two phenomnon can coexist. 

Let‚Äôs talk about me now. Because I believe you want more than just life advice from a random teenager, you want his personal anecdotes too. So I love to study many things. I consider myself a ‚ÄúChief Questionnaire‚Äù. My role in my life is usually to ask questions ( perhaps a lot of them as you will read in my letter of recomendations ) make observations and build theories on them. 

I have a todoist app where I record every question that I have and here are the last few that I added in my list: 

1. Why are there wires above train and why does train have a special thing to touch them
2. Why do trees yellow from the top down during the fall, why not the bottom up or radially from inside out or outside in?

As you can see, these questions don‚Äôt really belong to a specific subject. 

Unless that subject is ‚ÄúWhy ‚Ä¶.‚Äù

I do truly believe in the idea of any person any subject, in fact. I believe in
