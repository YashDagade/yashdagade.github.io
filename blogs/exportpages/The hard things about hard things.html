        <p>The main lessons from the book:</p>
<ol>
<li>Embrace the chaos - it’s hard and it’s unscripted and even though the problem is unique, the situation of having a unique problem is far from it</li>
<li>Be a good CEO -<ol>
<li>Hire the best person for your company now, not 2 years down the line anticipating growth. Hire now, Evaluate Always, Fire soon</li>
<li>Bad news travels fast- so don’t make your mind and not say anything - Execute once you have made your mind. If you haven’t, don’t speak about it</li>
<li>The culture is set by the first few people at the company so choose them well. Also don’t pick unique cultures, a culture is something that is surprising and highlights a value that the companies have - amazon’s door desks are a great example. They need to always highlight something that will be a conversation starter</li>
<li>It’s much easier for new people to do “old things” and follow a lead than it is for old people to follow new things. That says two things, keep the employees flowing - only the CEO is the fixed position, the executive team has to be flowing. Second, it’s important to try new things and with new people</li>
<li>Promotion and Politics - Promotions can decrease performance too and non deserved promotions can decrease company morale. A good promotion can be motivating, promote for effort, not for politics. Also don’t promote when employee has a better offer, it’s not about that employee (even if the salary is confidential) it’s about everyone else in the company</li>
<li>Firing - Once you make your mind, fire fast. Also firing is not about the employees that are laid off, it’s about everyone else who was “lucky” enough to stay. The morale will decrease so it’s important to point out that you failed here, not the company. Also that you will do something better this time. </li>
<li>“Big Money Employees” ⇒ Can be many times wrong, because they deal with different tasks and different timelines. They deal with months on end making a precise decision to help the product thrive, here you have to make 900 decisions daily just to keep the company alive. If they are not adding value in the first month - FIRE THEM IMMEDIATELY!</li>
<li>CEO’s biggest job is to train their people. If you don’t train your people, the company slows down. Get them upto speed and train them yourself, don’t get another person to train them. Your company is still small that you are the supreme leader and you know the most, sot your training is the most important. </li>
<li>Give Feedback - The only way to give feedback without offending people off is to give it regularly and to everyone. Give it on your first interaction and every interaction since. You will shape a more positive and receiving company if everyone is more honest. (Not sure but imo Kevin Zhu does the same when he says “i am proud of you”)</li>
<li>Titles - Get a title and delegate. It’s much easier to appoint one person the head and let the other person be sad than to have two heads. Two heads will slow everything down and that is possibly the last thing you want. Instead just bite the bullet and make one person the head. That’s how you will survive and that’s the most important job. </li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Overall a good book for anyone just looking for advice on how to be a good leader and CEO when starting a company. Few things that I found surprising, most of them were rather already known. But still a good refresher to have. A good recommendation in the sophomore year of college, when I will be hopefully avoiding the mistakes listed in here as I start a successful company.</p>
