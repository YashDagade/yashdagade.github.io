        <h1>Top 40</h1>
<p>Date: January 12, 2024</p>
<p>It’s not about me. It’s about hope.</p>
<p>See my application has many things going for it - let’s check the AI thing once again but I think I will be top 40 because I have EyeDa. I do have some typos but they are all good and guess what, I have really good essays, hard courses, everything is good. </p>
<p>Also the research is good. GREAT! Actually!</p>
<p>The Recs are great! Except dixit possibly the rest are GREAT!</p>
<p>Now it comes to all the technical essays- they are great too! And so are the non technical ones! The fact that I have an essay on purpose- honestly some say it was one of the best essays I have written. </p>
<p>My essay on running and smiling is probably one of the most humane essays I have written so far. It is also very good and highlights the human behind the work. </p>
<p>Some potential problems</p>
<ol>
<li>I say we have 20 vijay says 8 that is a problem</li>
<li>I say winner of JSHS - I guess it is not technically wrong because I didn’t say national, I meant tri state, but I guess it doesn’t matter</li>
</ol>
<p>Okay to be honest, those problems are minute and every time I look at the STS application it feel reliving. It feels strong it feels good. STS wants leaders in STEM, I show that, how</p>
<ol>
<li>Patent</li>
<li>Publish</li>
<li>Great Quality Research</li>
<li>EyeDa - message well conceived that I created a research group after personal reasons</li>
<li>Awards and Honors</li>
<li>Hard Courses taken and taking that are impressive</li>
</ol>
<p>This is the exact kind of thing they are looking for and they will definitely pick me I am so sure of it! </p>
<p>See I will get top 40 - It will be Yash Dagade, son of vaishali dagade is the founder of EyeDa, a research initiative he founded to end distracted driving. He is also a robotics mentor and volunteers at the Airplane restoration group. </p>
<p>He is a diver and has a patent!  </p>
<p>See I think I will be a top 40 finalist because I do have everything needed to be there! </p>

<p>Okay so we do have the research report that is top notch! Recs are great! Transcript really good! Core application is strong! all the activities are good!</p>
<p>They say their selection riterio is strength of research through other scientific merit- Getting a patent, doing LLJ research, national merit semifainalist are all great examples actually of this!</p>
<p>Student Contribution is a lot! Academic aptitude is high! Potential for future leader is EyeDa!</p>
<p>First thing they say is we are not looking for perfection! I don’t have that so that is actually a + it humanizes me and shows faliure side of me. Also USNCO 5th in state for academic aptitude and ancheivment too!</p>
<p>You know what - they are prolly not going to be fact checking and technically I was never wrong so we are good about JSHS!!!</p>
<p>Great job. Plus if they pick Davidson fellow they are bound to pick a JSHS winner too so nothing to worry about.</p>
<p>I think we got top 40 easy!</p>
