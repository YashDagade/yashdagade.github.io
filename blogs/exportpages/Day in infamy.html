        <h1>Day in infamy</h1>
<p>Tags: IDK Yet</p>
<p>I feel pretty sad today. It’s because I was waitlisted from MIT. Mit was my dream school and it was actually a bit dissapointing to get the email. Petey told me that I should expect the email in the next couple weeks, not today. </p>
<p>When he said it, I almost didn’t trust him. But I guess it doesn’t matter. I trust him now. And it makes sense that I wasn’t allowed. I am ofcourse sad, but I hope it wasn’t like this. I hope we didn’t do this. I don’t know about transfer applications. Willl the financial aid be the same, will everything be the same. Should I take a gap year, no not really. </p>
<p>To be completelyhonest, I am still hopeful for at least some good news, I hope I get it. I don’t know though. It would be pretty sad if if I don’t. I hope I am able to go to MIT or else I will have to go to duke. </p>
<p>Duke is pretty bad. I don’t want to spend four years of my life there. Not really. I guess I will hvae to than hope for either a transfer or a gap year. Both of which -…. well here are the thoghts on both of them</p>
<ol>
<li>Transfer - I don’t want to be the kid who is only knon for 3 years. That kinda sounds weak and I really don’t want to be known for only 2 weeks. As f</li>
<li>Gap year = I don’t wan tto wait a year. That sounds really bad. What am I supposed to do in that yar? Even if I get a better tet score and with all my achivements they do accept me, do I want it? I don’t know? I don’t think I do. It would be kind of sad if I went there a yar older than all. What would I do in that time? </li>
</ol>
<p>Gap year does sound pretty bad. I have around 13 months to do absolutely nothing and I will not do that. Even if I do get into MIT that’s a lot of wasted space. </p>
<p>So I guess I go to Duke. .Why do I hate duke though? It’s probably because it dosen’t have the best rankings. It is not super good at engineering or gcomputer science. They don’t have the best diversity. They are still unofically associated with ac hurch, so is stanford byt teh way so  does it really matter? I don’t know. It also has a devil as it’s mascot which is just evil. I don’t know why any living thinking person would wnat to show that as a mascot. </p>
<p>It is  alsojust not princeotn or mit or harvard or stanford. It is duke. </p>
<p>So in my mind I am hoping to make another call to petey and ask him for the one last time if there is litreally anything that could be done? Like perhaps the new awards? Will the commitee weant me please? Like I seem like a person that theys hould want </p>
<p>I want to call petey and ask him that. </p>
<p>He will most likley tell me, I am so sorry but no We can’t do anything. We can’t give you a seat. I can ask them waht if someon dosne’t chos eto get off but I don’t want to. So I guess yes, they an’t tell me anything. </p>
<p>I can however ask them what advice do you you have regarding transsfer applications and gap year? </p>
<p>Also if something meaningful comes out of that conversation, that would be great. If not than I canyk always you know go to duke.</p>
