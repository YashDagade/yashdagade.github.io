        <h1>bit scared rn</h1>
<p>Date: July 21, 2024</p>
<p>I am a bit scared rn</p>
<p>Scared of mom not getting PhD and still being house wife even after I am at duke</p>
<p>Scared that I won’t be with my mom and she will be lonely</p>
<p>Scared that mom will have to deal with a lot of fights in India</p>
<p>I don’t know but I do feel a bit scared. </p>
<p>Here are the thigns that I am really scared off. First, i don’t know about mom but I am not sure why she still wants to go back to kulkarni for phd. That person litreally cost mom so much and she is still going to go back to him. There will be a lot of rage there and neither parties are easy going. Both are easy to get angry.</p>
<p>Mom is already not super confident about her thesis so I don’t know how this works. </p>
<p>The most likely senario here is that kulkarni sees something in mom’s work and tell’s mom to request an extension, fix the thing and only than talk to her. Else kulkarni will not do mom’s phd. </p>
<p>And if that happens, mom will once again do sunk cost fallecey and that means that mom will once again say okay and come back.</p>
<p>I think that the probablity that mom comes back with a yes for phd is kind of low. Because first mom is not super confident and seond kulkarni will always have somethign more to give to mom so he may tell mom to do just a bit more and a bit more and a bit more</p>
<p>and the year that was supposed to be 2020 when mom would get her Ph.D PE and Driving License is now 2024 and soon 2025 and than 2026 and so on. Idk how this ends unless either mom get’s it this year or she leaves kulkarni</p>
<p>I also don’t know the situation with atul. Atul is a very incompetent person and he should be punished and he should not be lived after. He dosne’t deserve any respect. His way of helping someone who needs help is to lock them up. I really wish someone as creul and dumb as him becomes his boss. He really deserves to be punished for what he has done to mom.</p>
<p>And as far as mom goes, I really hope that being alone helps her. She will meet a lot of new people and they will help mom build a thriving support system. She has to priortize health, she has to priortize getting a driving licnesen and getting a job. </p>
<p>she also always has the student option. She is a very smart person and I know things will be okay for here but I really hope they do get okay.</p>
<p>Yk what may be she does get a phd this year</p>
