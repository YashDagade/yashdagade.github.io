<p>Wow, okay so I write this after watching this movie called love and other drugs. It has an amazing message and the main person reminds me of kevin paffarath from meet kevin, so thats really nice. </p>
<p>The main thing that I think I learned from this movie and is going to stick with me is this sentence: </p>
<p>”I suppose it dosen’t matter if I have 10,000 moments or just this one as I am happy it happened”</p>
<p>I resonate with it because I think there is only one shot, one good shot that you need.</p>
