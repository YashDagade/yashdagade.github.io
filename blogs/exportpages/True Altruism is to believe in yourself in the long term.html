<p>I don’t know, may be I am wrong but one of my main believes - my purpose on this planet when I think about it - is actually to have a greater impact on this planet - I know in a 100 years, I won’t exist, but I want my contributions to have shaped this world in a much stronger way. Sometimes that means taking decisions that others are afraid of, but as long as the history books get it right, I should push forward.</p>
<p>There are few things that I want to talk about here - </p>
<ol>
<li>The time it takes to do stuff is not as much as your brain anticipates it to be<ol>
<li>It’s either almost always more</li>
<li>Or always less</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>So that’s why when people tell me they are working on college apps all summer or when I tell myself that I have to submit a paper to a journal by end of summer, it is going to fail. Those goals aren’t tangible because no matter what - I will not be satisfied with my submission no matter how good it is. </p>
<p>The main way I have been working on to cope with this is to submit on deadline so I don’t get an opportunity to be sad. The main effect this has had on me though is the fact that I have started to sleep late, I have started to be more worried, started to actually waste a lot of my time. </p>
<p>My time will be more valuable to me if I were to instead focus on getting things write early and leaving. </p>
<p>In theory, it should work well. In practice it is hard to execute. I think I can execute it though. Some of the most important life lessons I have learned are the fact that no one is doing any thing that I can’t myself do. Can do pretend to do it better, yes. Can they continue to do it better, No. </p>
<p>This is also a 2 way street. I am not going to be the best at everything either. It is okay to learn that and embrace that. </p>
<p>There have to be some rather serious changes that I have to do -</p>
<ol>
<li>Get Healthy. <ol>
<li>The curve of get healthy peaks at midnight and is at minimum in the morning. Opposite of how it should be</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Get ProActive<ol>
<li>This can only be achieved with a robust timeline and an aptitude to do things. To remind myself of a higher purpose for this planet.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Value my time<ol>
<li>No more spending hours looking at early action college websites. I know in the spur it seems productive, but it is not. More productive is to seek professional help. More productive is to excel in one thing and collaborate with others who excel in their thing.</li>
</ol>
