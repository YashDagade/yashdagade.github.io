<p>Tags: Personal</p>
<p>A bad decision may have a slight negative cost and a good decision may have a really good positive cost, but taking time to make a decision has the worst cost. </p>
<p>Mom did her Ph.D. and when it was 3 years in, she knew she had a really bad guide. She wanted to leave her, however decided not to do it. Since Ph.D. was just going to be “next Diwali”. Diwalis came and went, but she kept on struggling. </p>
<p>It was the sunk cost fallacy, every time leaving the Ph.D. felt like a big big investment. So she never did that. She never left her guide. And to this date, 11 years later, she is still struggling. Ph.D. got mom from having a thriving career to now becoming a stay at home wife who keeps on struggling. </p>
<p>Of course mom is really great, but she is indecisive. When making the decision about leaving the person, mom is able to formulate the fact that the present is really not good at all. But she is still not able to take the decision to leave, because she keeps on dwelling on the past. </p>
<p>That seems like a bad offer. I remember in 2020, during the mist of COVID, Sayyad offered mom to transfer her and would give her a Ph.D. and mom said, no it will take me 3 years with you. I know for fact that if mom had taken a progressive person like Sayyad, who has already given so many Ph.D. degrees to so many other students, my mom would be better off. </p>
<p>She would be better of technically, as she would understand a lot more. She would have a deep mental understanding of the state space and would be ready to take on complex problem even in United States. She would be better off mentally as she would be much calmer and would have published way more papers. She would have felt a lot more acomplished and by now would have finished her Ph.D. </p>
<p>But mom decided to continue in the sunk cost. And I guess, at the time it made sense. In 2020 mom thought that because of covid, every one is online so mom would surely get the Ph.D. She expected the phd to be done by Diwali, and the Diwali never came.</p>
<p>This is tangential and I don’t have the words here but I am going to call it the doingness spirit. That is a very important spiritual- the spirit to just take the leap of faith and do it. The spirit to decide to go on the highway when you are learning. The spirit to leave Kulkarni or the sprint to go on a ride.</p>
<p>The thing is that you need to be based in reality though. You need to look at the history and accurately make predictions for the future.</p>
<p>Like knowing the fact that Kulkarni is a bad person, and that the history hasn’t fared well, you should be able to make the conclusion that it’s not worth spending time with him anymore, </p>
<p>Hairy and got feelings are very important and the idea to push through almost always ends up being torture.</p>
<p>When making decisions the speed is super super important.</p>
