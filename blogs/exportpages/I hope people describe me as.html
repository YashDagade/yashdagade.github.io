<p>I hope when people describe me, they do it as a builder, a simplistic and a polymath. I think the simplest part is underrepresented in my life now. But I truly do believe in it. Simple is elegant. Simple things are easy to understand, they are easy to work on. </p>
<p>People don’t like to ask questions, it’s too much effort. And if people don’t understand things, they are useless. Everything can be described in simple terms and if it would be, the productivity for each person would be as close to 100% as it can be. </p>
<p>Completeness is important too. Expressing notions in a complete and rigid manner is vital, but it has to be simple too.</p>
