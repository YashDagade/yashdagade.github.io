        <h1>What does this mean?</h1>
<p>Tags: Personal</p>
<p>I am not a big fan of the EOS talks, I would rather appreciate them to occur at the beginning. So the problem is with HW3 and Quiz 4 and Project. For HW3, I did everything - arpita copied my work. </p>
<p>For Quiz 4 - we have the same scores and the same answers so there is a “good hint”</p>
<p>Now the problem is this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Quiz 4 - The answers for the last one - we both put the last 2 and nothing else (this is the only hint that something may be off)<ol>
<li>Okay - we spoke and here are the things we are clear on <ol>
<li>We took it from home</li>
<li>SHE called me at the end telling and I said I did not Q and not Q not R because I thought it was a 4 point quesiton so it only made sense - I was under the impression that she had submitted</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Homework 3<ol>
<li>She copied my work - she says she used chatgpt - i say I had a novel idea - there is some problem here but it feels resolved</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Learnings after speaking with Exeley and Mario:</p>
<ol>
<li>Exeley is chill and he doesn’t seem to be the driver behind getting Arpita Expelled - it seems like mario is the one</li>
<li>Mario wants arpita out - I don’t care. I am okay with doing all the work but I don’t want her out, Exley doesn’t want her out - Mario Does</li>
<li>It seems like mario is taking this the wrong way and that it is better for him to step aside than willingly try to get some one expelled - It’s just flat out wrong</li>
</ol>
<p>Exeley said he will consider that if our project is very well done than he may use that to bump my grade to an A-. He did not mention anything about HW3 and Quiz 4- it means two things - first he either feels like they are in the past and doesn’t care. Second - he plans to file a case against me. Any who - I think I should end up with an A- in the long run - by reminding him about the injustice of WA4 - by perhaps taking this to the UMN court and by reminding him about the points for Short Quiz 2 and Short Quiz 10.</p>
<p>I am so scared this is not good. I have wasted so much time and I feel like I am falling apart. Will I get into a good college, will they still accept me if I have a B on my transcript. I probably will get an A- but I don’t know. I will go to court to get justice for my grade! I will not accept any grade that is not a level of A. </p>
<p>In my defense - I did take a 4000 level class. </p>
<p>Also WTF man - i am guaranteed to walk away with an A- - after doing the math it is not that hard to see so why bother</p>
<p>Mario Said this:</p>
<p>I don't want to talk about it anymore. I am really frustrated and disappointed. Arpita is a cheater, a manipulator, a liar and she took advantage of you. I tried to help you get your grade in the best way I could, which is telling you what you should focus on knowing how this goes. Not because of the scholarship, though of course I'd be super happy if you made it, but because it is the right thing to do and I wanted to defend your hard work. I already did too much for you to the point where I'm feeling uncomfortable that I may be in violation of school policy. Given that there is unclear evidence of scholastic misconduct from your side (homework 3), this has now become a conflict of interest. I cannot advise you moving forward, and I don't want to talk anymore until this is resolved and if you clear your name. You need to stand up for yourself now. I wish you luck and if this matter is resolved I welcome you to talk to me again, I am not burning this bridge. But this has seriously brought me a lot more stress than you could possibly imagine and I've gone above and beyond for you in a way I never have for any student. I'm done.</p>
<p>I want to say this</p>
<p>I really admire and respect that. I feel deeply disappointed to have been in a position involving the terms "dishonesty." I know for fact that you are trying to protect me and my work and I really appreciate it. I am <strong>furious at Arpita</strong> for repeatedly not working in a team spirit. In fact, before today, one of my resolutions of the year was to be very cautious when entering team projects - since in all the college courses I have taken so far, they have been independent and I have really enjoyed them. However, this has been one of the most stressful courses for all the wrong reasons. </p>
<p>However, after reflecting on my own life for just a few minute I changed my mind. I forgive Arpita. I know you will probably not like this decision and perhaps in a few years, I won’t like it either; but so far the way I have been raised and the generosity with which people have responded, it is only fair that I do the same to others. Hence, I forgive her. I know our culture has a big importance on punishments and warnings as a method for learning and we are in a fear based education system. It is still very much carrots and sticks. I believe we should strive for an education system where it is not like that. Where what counts is the work done and the impact on other people’s life. If I don’t forgive and forget about the incidence with artpita I would never move on and always be stuck alone. I will never learn to build new teams and always look at the worst in people. </p>
<p>I know it may feel like Arpita took advantage of me and got away with it, but I chose a different vantage point. I chose the point of - “ I learned so much about people management and time managements that not even a course could have taught me.” And arpita actually lost because she had a chance to get herself ready for the world and learn great skills, she did not take advantage of that. Maybe she graduates with a great grade but she will not have learned the skills that this course had to offer and that opportunity cost I believe would be more important for her future than anything I decide to do be. </p>
<p>I hope everything works out all right; I trust everything will work out all right. After all good always wins over the bad over the long run and honesty always wins. I know this time will be no different.</p>
