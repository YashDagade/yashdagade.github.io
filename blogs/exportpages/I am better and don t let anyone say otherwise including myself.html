<p>Okay so let’s talk life right now-</p>
<p>I have emails that I am overdue in sending for MIT and Harvard Waitlist</p>
<p>I have drawings that should have been out to stratasys by now but are not</p>
<p>I have Homeworks that were due yesterday but I haven’t yet done</p>
<p>I have Tests coming up that I don’t know one bit about</p>
<p>I have Projects that I have done absolutely nothing for</p>
<p>I have an ISEF submission that is coming up fast</p>
<p>With all of that I have</p>
<p>A Mom who is being abused by the family and I can’t help her</p>
<p>A family that is on the verge off collapsing and should have collapsed (but didn’t)</p>
<p>Most people don’t have that… Most people don’t battle collapsing family and abusing dads… I do. </p>
<p>The worst night mare that I wouldn’t wish on anyone is to now forcefully spend a weekend with my dad at the Washington in the same hotel ( i really don’t want to go, don’t want to give him that pleasure… yes why would I. I have seen the truth, even if it was fake to all, it was true to me) </p>
<p>so yeah. talk about life getting real. But even if this is the rock bottom (which realistically it isn’t) I am ready to fight it. </p>
<p>ready to file for a divorce, make mom a ~~millionaire~~ billionaire, fix life, improve life, not for my mom, not for me, but for the world. It’s time to succeed.</p>
<p>And  yk what - I will do it. I know it may get harder from here, but as it get’s hard - you get harder. Don’t collapse. Don’t hit the wall. Don’t cry. Get up ⇒ Look ahead and be optimistic. </p>
<p>The overall plan for the years coming up is to first - fix the family remove dagade from the name or may be not, just don’t have any A in the name - I am yash dagade and that’s it - may be not the dagade part but who really cares</p>
<p>second get jobs, get rich, be quick, be fast, be ethical and be kind. </p>
<p>third, the worst kind of pain isn’t physical — it’s mental. It is when you grow astronomically that people who had you before regret their life and are dared every day to exist ⇒ that is the thing I want to work towards. Not anything else. </p>
<p>I have a lot of things going on ⇒ which implies that (just like it should be) most of the decisions I will take now, I get one shot at, one opportunity to succeed. It’s that or nothing - it’s do or die here.</p>
<p>And I choose do ⇒ to do it right the first time.</p>
