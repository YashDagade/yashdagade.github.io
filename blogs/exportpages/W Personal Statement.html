<p>Starting Things is Easy. Doing them requires grit. Finishing is art. I have gone through three distinctive stage in my life, each stage starting with a discovery that has vastly changed me.</p>
<p>Let’s start with the era of starting things. It is easy to start something and for many tasks, such as taking a graduate level computational biology class, enrolling is all that you need to do. Would the journey have it’s ups and downs, of course it will, but in the grand scheme of things the decision to “Just do it” would probably end up with a net positive. </p>
<p>However for some things, like: </p>
<p>Short distance track, long distance track, shotput, pole vault, swimming, tennis, cricket, soccer, wrestling, karate, skating, dance. </p>
<p>Starting is not enough</p>
<p>That is a list of all the sports that I have done for at least a year before I quit, mostly because of not seeing any improvement in myself. So my freshman year, after recently quitting tennis due to a hand injury I had the option of picking yet another sport, diving. And this time, it was different. Mostly because I promised myself, I won’t quit for my highschool carrier, a decision that may be the best one of my life. </p>
<p>Mainly because it taught me how to push through in life. You see, starting was easy and up till now I had started many things. But when it came to doing them - the story would usually go like this, it would start off great, things would gradually become more and more challenging untill eventually I felt a self burden on myself and I would tense up and get stressed about the sport. In the following weeks, I would start skipping classes and eventually I would end up quitting. </p>
<p>I was wife enough when starting this sport to recognize this pattern for myself as well. And this time too it started with a great start, leading to being scared of smacking ( still a gerat fear) to starting to not like the sport as much. </p>
<p>However, this time I shared my problem with my mom and the words that followed probably changed the trajectory of my life. “ You don’t need everything to be picture perfect to be happy, Happiness is a function of self” You see, the key to grit, weather it is the grit that I need to ace a test or the grit I need to continue running even when my entire body would rather collapse down or here when it is to continue diving is all in the simple act of smiling.</p>
<p>When things get tough, you just need to remember to smile. This task is actually as easily done as said. It doesn’t take that much to realize when I am tensing, and when I am, I just remind myself to smile and keep working. </p>
<p>As soon as I remove the personal tension out of the equation, things start to become rather doable. Smacking still hurts, but it dosen’t haunt me anymore. </p>
<p>This realization propelled me into many things - removing the personal tension from a problem and soon doing things starts to beome rather easy. Like I learned to solve the cube, I forever was stuck on the 2nd layer and never went to the third layer until after I made this realization. </p>
<p>Doing things does increase your confidence and usually start - do - repeat are enough for many things including building a great team. Like when I started EyeDa, an initiative built upon the vision of using technology to solve problems, building team was easy when my happiness wasn’t a function of how the team was doing. It allowed people to trust me and fostered a more enovirnment. </p>
<p>However for some things, you have to learn how to finish things. And finishing things is something that I did not learn untill the end of this summer.  It is an artform. I learned about this art when finishing my research. When I say finishing, what I mean is publishing and patenting my research. So the thing about publishing is - it is an artform. I did so many things from schilern imaging to wind tunnel testing, however when it comes to peer reviewed journals, you go down a different rabbit hole. </p>
<p>Usually, I have found more to be better, however it took a summer for me to realize that less is more. For everything, from patenting coverage, where our entire design is novel however patenting just one aspect of the design is way more powerful and gives you way more coverage than patenting the entire desing. Patenting the novel aerodynamic shape of the helium balloon with the clauses listed, not only protects this design but also all the other constituting designs. </p>
<p>Similarly, for my research, I had done schlieren imaging, wind tunnel testing, CFD and so much more. However I could not write a paper about all these topics, I had to pick CFD and move on. I had to redo all the literature search, remove some propriety information about my paper while still giving enough such that the results are replicable and redo most of the simulations and than came publishing. </p>
<p>At each stage of the way - there was so much that we had to leave on the table. It was truly an art to pick and decide what to present, how to present it while protecting it. The usual theme for the paper was to pick a few topics and go in super detail about them instead of doing everything. Less is more, more is less!</p>
<p>And these are the three distinct stages of my life. In each stage, I learned a new catch phrase, from Just do it, to keep smiling, to less is more and each time it changed my vantage point on how I look at things. Sometimes there was an Aha moment liked to the change while other times the discovery was gradual, but hey that’s just how science goes.</p>
