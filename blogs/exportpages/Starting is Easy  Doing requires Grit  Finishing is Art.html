<p>Starting is Easy. Doing requires Grit. Finishing is Art. I can categorize my life into three different categories. I remember when I was young, I was comfortable with the starting things, but every time it came to doing them I would struggle.</p>
<p>What made me change my mid I believe was cross country - learning to smile and push through the hard times. It is a weird feeling but when I seperate myself from the true problem, I stop focusing on me and start focusing on the problem.</p>
<p>Sticking is also grit. Starting things and quitting is fairly comman but starting things and sticking is rarely. Rightly so sometimes, I believe we make some decisions at our absolute emotional highs or lows so it never ends up executing because as soon as we move away from that emotional state, we also tend to move away from the decisions made during that emotional state. </p>
<p>I wonder if there is some research on that - but I believe there will be an interesting correlation between starting things and sticking to them when you start in an emotional opitma.</p>
