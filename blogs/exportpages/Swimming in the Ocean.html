        <h1>Swimming in the Ocean</h1>
<p>Date: March 7, 2024</p>
<p>This is inspired by the phrase that the young fish tell the old fish “ I wanna swim in the ocean”</p>
<p>The old fish says “you are in the ocean”</p>
<p>The young fish says “no this isn’t ocean this is just water”</p>
<p>As I think about this- I realize how much I am limiting my self - and so many in the world are too from so g what they want to do.</p>
<p>I know it’s limiting yourself when the thought process goes like- I will do this when I get this done- like I will start a company after I go to a good college.</p>
<p>That’s just a waste of time and that company is never gonna start. Because I will find another reason to postpone it.</p>
<p>The startup culture in cali is no different than the one in Minnesota- it’s still all just water- so there is no reason to wait. </p>
<p>Start now!</p>
