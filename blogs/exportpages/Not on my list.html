<p>I am on the war zone die of the bell curve, not the sweet side of it :( and that is kind of sad. </p>
<p>But it doesn’t matter. I wish the double derivative was the thing that people paid attention to when evaluating candidates. Not the intercept. The intercept matters for sure, but it is not a controllable. The double derivative speaks to independence and execution abilities of a task. And maintaining a stable + double derivative is quite hard, so if someone is able to maintain it for a long time than that should be valued. </p>
<p>Anywho, it doesn’t matter. I was waitlisted by MIT - I am hopeful I will get in. I kinda know from the bottom of my heart that I will get in. But I am not even that sad. My top choice is actually stanford so I am hopeful for that. </p>
<p>I think I have a real shot at stanford, princeton or harvard. </p>
<p>But that’s not the point. The point is - amongst all the things that are important for me to think about right now, I am quite certain that speculating which college I go into is not one of them. </p>
<p>Yes! I love MIT. And I will go to MIT any day! </p>
<p>But not because it’s MIT! It’s because they have a pathos that attracts the best and the brightest minds around the world. </p>
<p>And that, I can get anywhere, not just at MIT. I respect MIT for attracting such bright talent. But that talent is not limited only to MIT. So don’t worry - whatever happens happens for good.</p>
